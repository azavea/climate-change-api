Indicator Dictionary
====================

This dictionary provides a high-level description of each indicator available through the Climate API.


.. note:: If you are trying to make an indicator REST API call, look up the indicator's `parameter details`_ or follow `how to make an indicator request`_.


In the explanations below, assume temperature and precipitation values are aggregated across all requested models for a specified period of time. For brevity, temperature refers to surface air temperature. Historic refers to 1950-2006.
