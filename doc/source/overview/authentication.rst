Authentication
--------------

All requests to the Climate API must be authenticated. The Climate API supports the Token authentication scheme via HTTP header.

Your token must be provided in the ``Authorization`` HTTP Header with every request. The key should be prefixed by the string literal ``Token``, with whitespace separating the two strings::

    Authorization: Token <your token here>

Guard your API token carefully. If compromised, it can be regenerated by going to your |Profile|. Note that if you regenerate your token, any applications using your old token will cease to operate.

Your token can be found in your |Profile| while logged in, or by making a POST request to `/api-token-auth/`_.
