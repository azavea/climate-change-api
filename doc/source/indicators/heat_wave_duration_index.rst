Heat Wave Duration Index
------------------------

The Heat Wave Duration Index |(HWDI)| measures the maximum period of at least 5 consecutive days with daily high temperature greater than 5˚C above historic average high temperature norms. If the historic norm was 85˚F, a period of 6 consecutive days with maximum daily temperatures above 94˚F (5˚C = 9˚F) would register at 1 on the HWDI. This indicator provides a more specific and nuanced look at the extent and intensity of warming than `average high temperature`_ or even `extreme heat events`_. It is closely related to `heat wave incidents`_.

- `historic_range`_

    Optionally set the years used to define "historic" to an available consecutive period of 30 years, i.e. 1961-1990. Specify a time period by its start_year, *historic_range=1951*. Defaults to the most current time period available.
