Precipitation Threshold counts the number of days in a user-specified time period where the daily total precipitation meets a user-specified condition. The condition is required and includes a value and a comparison operator, such as "less than or equal to" (lte). This indicator has broad applications depending on the user's area of expertise, as it allows for the user to generate on-the-fly custom operations.

For example, you could generate a "Number of Dry Days" indicator by using the following options:

- threshold=0
- threshold_comparator=lte
- threshold_units=in
