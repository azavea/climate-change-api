Total Precipitation returns the summed daily precipitation ranging the user-specified period of time. It is an appropriate first-pass metric for probable long term precipitation trends. Total precipitation is broad because it waters down information on precipitation event intensity, particularly the longer the period of time. For a more thorough look, consider further analysis with `yearly max consecutive dry days`_ or `extreme precipitation events`_.
