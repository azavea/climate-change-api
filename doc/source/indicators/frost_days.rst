Frost Days reports the number of days where the daily low temperature drops below 32˚F or 0˚C. The presence of, lack of, and schedule of frost days have strong impacts on growing seasons, permafrost, and heating demands, for example. While the freezing point of water varies slightly with local environmental conditions, for simplicity this indicator assumes a consistent 32˚F/0˚C. To customize freezing point, see the `min temperature threshold indicator`_.
