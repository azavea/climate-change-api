Cooling Degree Days (CDD) is the difference between a reference temperature and the daily average temperature for each day summed over some time span. For example, a day with average temperature of 80°F and a reference temperature of 65°F would equal 15 CDDs. CDD magnitude corresponds directly with warmth. CDD approximates air conditioning use which accounts for `roughly half of energy demand during the summer`_. The default reference temperature is 65°F.
