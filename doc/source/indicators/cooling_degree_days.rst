Cooling Degree Days (CDD) is the total difference between a reference base temperature and the daily average temperature over some time span. CDD is a measurement of air conditioning use, which accounts for `roughly half of energy demand during the summer`_. The default reference temperature of 65Â° F is an adjustable parameter.
