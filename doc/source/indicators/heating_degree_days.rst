Heating Degree Days (HDD) is the difference between the daily average temperature and a reference temperature summed for all days over some time span. For example, a day with average temperature of 40°F and a reference temperature of 60°F would equal 20 HDDs. HDD magnitude corresponds inversely with how cold it is. HDD can be used to approximate heat use in buildings. The default reference temperature is 65°F or the temperature below which a building would be heated.
