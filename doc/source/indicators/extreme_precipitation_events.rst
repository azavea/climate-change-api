Extreme Precipitation Events
----------------------------

Extreme Precipitation Events counts the number of times total daily precipitation exceeds the specified percentile of total historic daily precipitation. The percentile defaults to 99. This indicator is useful to understand future heavy precipitation and inform resource planners of changes to prepare for.
