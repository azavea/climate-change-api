Accumulated Freezing Degree Days (AFDD) is calculated as the maximum consecutive sum of the difference from daily average temperature to freezing (0 Â°C). Because AFDD is minimally bounded at 0 during aggregation, the metric is somewhat resilient against warm outlier values. A higher AFDD suggests a colder period.

This indicator is a measure of the potential amount of freezing an area may experience during a specified period, and can be used to approximate maximum ice thickness. For more information on this use see |ice thickness paper|.
