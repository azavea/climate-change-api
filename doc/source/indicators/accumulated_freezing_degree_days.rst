Accumulated Freezing Degree Days (AFDD) is calculated by taking the consecutive day-to-day sum of the difference from daily average temperature to freezing (With the total bounded at 0 Â°C during warm stretches), and reports the maximum total reached. It is a measure of the potential amount of freezing an area may experience during winter, and can be used to approximate maximum ice thickness.
