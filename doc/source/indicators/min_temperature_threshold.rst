Min Temperature Threshold counts the number of days in a user-specified time period where the daily low temperature meets a user-specified condition. The condition is required and includes both a value and a comparison operator, such as "less than" (lt.) This indicator has broad applications depending on the user's area of expertise, as it allows for custom comparisons and provides a more general interface to more specific indicators.

For example, the Frost Days indicator is the same as using this indicator with the following options set:

- threshold=0
- threshold_comparator=lt
- threshold_units=C
