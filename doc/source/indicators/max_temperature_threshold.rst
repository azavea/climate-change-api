Max Temperature Threshold counts the number of days in a user-specified time period where the daily high temperature meets a user-specified condition. The condition is required and includes a value and a comparison operator, such as "greater than" (gt). This indicator has broad applications depending on the user's area of expertise, as it allows for the user to generate on-the-fly custom operations.

For example, you could generate a "Number of Extreme Heat Days" indicator by using the following options:

- threshold=95
- threshold_comparator=gt
- threshold_units=F
