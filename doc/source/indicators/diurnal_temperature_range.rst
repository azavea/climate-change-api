Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR) is the average difference between the maximum temperature and minimum temperature in a day. It measures how much it heats or cools in a day. A decreasing |DTR| suggests a warming climatic trend but is only a rough measure as DTR can be skewed by many factors such as cloud cover, urban heat island effect, and aerosols.
