Heat Wave Incidents
-------------------

Heat Wave Incidents counts the days the daily high temperature exceeds 5ËšC above historic average high temperature norms for at least 5 consecutive days. This indicator is closely paired with `heat wave duration index`_ and, similarly, provides a concrete and palpable metric to the impacts of global warming. Frequency, duration, and intensity predictions of heat waves are very important for |health| and emergency services planning. See California's comprehensive |impact assessment|.

- `historic_range`_

    Optionally set the years used to define "historic" to an available consecutive period of 30 years, i.e. 1961-1990. Specify a time period by its start_year, *historic_range=1951*. Defaults to the most current time period available.
