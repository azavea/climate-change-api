Heat Wave Incidents counts the days the daily high temperature exceeds 5ËšC above historic average high temperature norms for at least 5 consecutive days. This indicator is closely paired with `heat wave duration index`_ and similarly provides a concrete and palpable metric to the impacts of global warming. Frequency, duration, and intensity predictions of heat waves are very important for `health`_ and emergency services planning. See California's comprehensive `impact assessment`_.
