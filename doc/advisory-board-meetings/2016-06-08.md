# Advisory Board Meeting - June 8, 2016


## Survey review

Concerns from Sara about east-coast centric view of disasters of primary concern

Mike - Can users add local data such as building infrastructure? Depends on who marketing to, but
if local decision makers, it would be of huge value


## Conclusions

C40 -- Willing to discuss the taxonomy in more detail:
http://www.c40.org/researches/city-climate-hazard-taxonomy
For the C40 taxonomy, who is the target market? Is this only valuable if the target is not
already familiar with and/or a member of C40

Balance between providing raw metrics and actionable suggestions for local communities, where
the actionable items could be very creative and focused on a particular community.


## Using subsets of models

General consensus is to average all models and provide things like standard deviations and
indications on how much agreement there is in the models. No knowledge of active research or
publications that detail pros/cons of individual models.


## Additional indicators

Precipitation intensity - number of high percentile events?


## APIs

University programs - yes
Consultants - not so much

In research, consider folks outside of climate scientists, such as economists, etc.

Consider being available to explain how we arrived at the responses to the API for data researchers,
they may be interested in validating the data and how we pulled it out of the netcdf.


## Lab

Good feedback on showing multiple indicators at a time, compare multiple cities, rank cities
by some criteria. City managers like to be able to compare themselves to other similar cities.


## Outreach

Engineering firms
Urban sustainability directors network (http://usdn.org/)
NPOs - Metro Washington
Association of Climate Change Officers (http://www.accoonline.org/)
Regional plan association
NOAA - specific offices?
Great Lakes Climate Adaptation Network
Amy Luers -- Assistant Director, Climate Resilience and Information, OSTP
